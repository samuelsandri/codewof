# Teenagers

Write a program that asks the user for their age and **prints** out whether 
they are a teenager. 

In this scenario a person who is at least 13 and younger than 20 is a teenager.

If the person is a teenager, then **print** out `You are a teen`.
If the person is not a teenager, then **print** out `You aren't a teenager`.
