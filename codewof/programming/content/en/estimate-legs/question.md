# Estimate Legs

You are working at a table making factory at the tabletop department. 
Every hour the leg department needs to know how many legs to produce (to keep up).
The leg department must make four legs for each table and an additional four spare legs (just in case).

Write a program that asks how many tabletops you've produced, 
then **prints** out an estimate for legs required for the next hour.
