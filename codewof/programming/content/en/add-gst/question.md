# Add GST

Make a function `add_gst(price, tax_percent)` takes two arguments:

- `price`: The original price of the item
- `tax_percent`: The tax that should be applied to the item, e.g. `15` for a 15% sales tax.

It should **return** the final cost of the item after the sales tax has been applied.
