# Is-a-Divisor

Write a program that asks for an initial integer. 
The program then repeatedly prompts for integers.
If the integer `i` **is** a divisor of the initial integer, print '`i` is a divisor'.
If the integer `i` **is not** a divisor of the initial integer, print '`i` is not a divisor'.
The program should continue until it is given the value 0 as input.

*Hint: a* `while` *loop is a good type of loop to use when you don't know how many times the loop will run.*
