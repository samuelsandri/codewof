# Plural words

Write a program that repeatedly asks the user for words that end with 's' (capital or lowercase). Each time it gets a word that ends with 's', it should **print**
`Yes, {given word} ends with s.` and prompt the user for another word.
Your program should keep asking the user for plural words until the user gives it a word that doesn't end with 's'.
Then your program should **print** `No, {given word} doesn't end with s!` and stop.

*Hints: A `while` loop is a good type of loop to use when you don't know how many times the loop will run. The string methods `str.endswith()` and `str.lower()` may also be helpful.*
