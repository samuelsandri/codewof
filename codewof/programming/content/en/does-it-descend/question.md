# Does It Descend?

The function `is_descending(items)` takes a list of numbers, `items`, and **returns** True if each item is in descending order. 

Ascending order means each item is greater than or equal to the next item.

There is a problem! It always returns False.

Find the bug (or bugs) to fix the function.
