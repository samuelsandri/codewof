# Acceleration Calculator
The following function `acceleration(velocity_initial, velocity_final, time)` takes the initial and final velocity of an object (m/s) and the time (s), and should return the correct acceleration (m/s<sup>2</sup>).

The difference between the final and initial velocities should be first calculated, then divided by the amount of time.

This function looks like it should work, but there are problems with it. Find the bug (or bugs) to fix the function.
