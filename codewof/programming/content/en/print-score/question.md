# Print Score

Write a function `print_score(points, total_possible)` that takes the number of points a player has scored, `points`, and the total number of points possible, `total_possible`, and **prints** their score as a percentage.

*Note: Format the percentage to one decimal point. 
You do not need to worry about rounding.*

For example if we call `print_score(4, 8)` the function should print `50.0%`.
