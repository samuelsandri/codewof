# Clean Room Debug

The following function `clean_room(room_contents, dirty_items)` takes a list of items in the room `contents` and **returns** a new list 
without any occurrences of messy items in the list `dirty_items`. 

Items in `room_contents` and `dirty_items` will always be lowercase.


But there's a problem! it seems to be returning the items in `dirty_items` that are in `room_contents` and removing the clean items.

Find the bug (or bugs) to fix the function.
