# Mountain Climbing

Write a function `number_of_steps(up_amount, height)` to return the **number of steps** required to climb a mountain of a specified `height`.
The climber starts at the base of the mountain (height is zero).
The climber climbs up by `up_amount` per step.
The climber reaches the top when their **current height is greater than or equal to the mountain `height`**.
