# Are we there yet?!

Write a program that repeatedly asks the user how far away from their holiday destination they are (in KM).
We have arrived when the entered distance is at most 5.0 KM away.
The program should print `No, not yet!` if we have not arrived. When we have arrived it should stop and say `Yes!`

*Hint: a* `while` *loop is a good type of loop to use when you don't know how many times the loop will run*
