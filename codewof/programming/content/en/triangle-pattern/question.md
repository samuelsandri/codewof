# Triangle pattern

Write a function `triangle(x)` that takes an integer `x` and **prints** out a triangle (made up of `*` symbols) of depth `x`.
For example if we call `triangle(5)` we would expect the output to be:

```
*
**
***
****
*****
```

If `x` is 1 or less, your function should **print** `That isn't a triangle!`
