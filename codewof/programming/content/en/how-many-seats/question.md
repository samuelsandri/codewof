# How Many Seats

Write a function `total_seats(vehicles)` that takes a list of strings representing vehicles passing by on a nearby road, `vehicles`, 
and **returns** an estimate of their total number of seats. The data will be used in a study about heavy vehicle usage.

In this scenario a `car` has 5 seats, a `truck` has 3 seats and a `bus` has 20 seats. 
We are only interested in counting these vehicles, any other vehicle is not included in the total.

The strings in `vehicles` will always be lower case.
