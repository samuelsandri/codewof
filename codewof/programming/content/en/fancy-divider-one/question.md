# Fancy divider one

Write a function `fancy_divider(divider_length)` that prints a fancy divider of length `divider_length`:

```
+------------------------------------------------+
```

- The first and last characters should be `+`
- All characters in-between should be `-`
- If divider_length is 1 or 2 it should print `+` or `++` respectively

Your function will not be tested with `divider_length` less than one 1
