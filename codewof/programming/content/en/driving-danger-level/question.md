# Driving danger level

Write a function `check_danger_level(is_dark, is_wet)` prints the current level of danger for the driver.
Where `is_dark`, `is_wet` are both booleans (True/False)

- If it's both dark and wet print `The driving conditions are currently VERY dangerous!!`
- If it's either dark or wet print `The driving conditions are currently dangerous!`
- Otherwise print `It is a nice day for a drive.`
