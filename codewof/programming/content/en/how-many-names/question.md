# How many names?

The following function `number_of_names(word_list)` takes a list of strings `word_list`, and **returns** the number of strings that are capitalized like a name.
We are only interested in the casing: `Sam` is a name, but `SAM` is not a name.

Find the bug (or bugs) to fix this function so that it passes all of the tests.

*Hint: the string method `str.istitle()` will return true if the string is a name*
