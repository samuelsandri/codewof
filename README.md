## Features

There are two major features of the CodeWOF project:

- Programming 'fitness' helper:
  With a free account you can maintain your basic programming skills with short daily programming exercises.
  Earn points and achievements while maintaining your coding Warrant of Fitness.
- Style checkers:
  We've rewritten professional code style standards to make them easier to understand for beginners.
  Our [style checkers](https://www.codewof.co.nz/style/) review your code with professional standards but provide simplified descriptions and examples to easily help you improve your coding style (no account needed).

Currently both features are available for Python 3; we would like to introduce more languages in future updates.

## Documentation

This is it! All of it.
We intend to create proper documentation in a full `docs` directory in the near future.
Don't be afraid to ask for help!

## Contributing

We would love your help to make CodeWOF as useful as it can be!
A contribution guide will be made available in the future.
